# Buddhism, Zen, Stoicism, Taoism, ...

I studied buddhist texts in earnest since August 2016 to maybe mid 2017: quite
by accident in fact, when I came across *Fearless* by Brenda Shoshanna, whose
heady mixture of modern psychology and ancient buddhist wisdom acted as a
gateway drug into a whole new way of looking at my mind and the world.

Buddhism led to a deep dive into ancient Greek stoicism.

This led to a dive into alternative living thought, such as Annie Hill and,
significantly impactfully, [Daniel Suelo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suelo).

Suelo's writings have got me started now down the brilliant writings of the
[Peace Pilgrim](http://www.peacepilgrim.com), and that of the ancient [Tao Te
Ching](http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~phalsall/texts/taote-v3.html).

I study these ideas regularly and try to integrate them into my day to day life.

## Finding Books

Many spiritual practices have been around for an exceedingly long time. This
works to your advantage in many ways. One such way is that your public library
will likely be a great resource for such books.

Your local library will have dozens of books on the subject, providing a near
endless source of free wisdom for the aspiring adventurer of the mind.

## Being Open

It cannot be overstated the importance of openness.

Expect nothing. This sounds bleak, but it's about the idea that when you don't
expect anything from other people or things, they will delight you over and over
again -- all without any disappointments.

Cherish people for their oddities and idiosyncracies. Don't hold them up to your
own set of values you live by: they aren't you.

See each of the world's disregards of your expectations as an opportunity, not a
cosmic insult. Learn to explore, not expect.

It took a long time for me to realize that people can tell the difference
between when you're open or closed. We can't connect with closed people. We
cannot connect with others when we are closed. Be open with others. Confidence
is borne from trust.
