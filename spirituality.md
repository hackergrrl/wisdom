# Buddhism & Zen

I've been studying buddhism since August 2016. Quite by accident in fact, when I
came across *Fearless* by Brenda Shoshanna, whose heady mixture of modern
psychology and ancient buddhist wisdom acted as a gateway drug into a whole new
way of looking at my mind and the world.

## Finding Books

Buddhism and zen have been around for an exceedingly long time. This works to
your advantage in many ways. One such way is that your public library will
likely be a great resource for such books.

My local San Jose MLK Library has many dozens of books on the subject, providing
a near endless source of free wisdom for the aspiring adventurer of the mind.

Dewey Decimal class 290 is for *Other Religions* -- you can find *Buddhism* (and
many others) under 294.


## Being Open

It cannot be overstated the importance of openness.

Expect nothing. This sounds bleak, but it's about the idea that when you don't
expect anything from other people or things, they will delight you over and over
again -- all without any disappointments.

Cherish people for their oddities and idiosyncracies. Don't hold them up to your
own set of values you live by: they aren't you.

See each of the world's disregards of your expectations as an opportunity, not a
cosmic insult. Learn to explore, not expect.

It took a long time for me to realize that people can tell the difference
between when you're open or closed. We can't connect with closed people. We cannot connect with others when we are closed. Be open with others. Confidence is borne from trust.


## Also: **NOT** spirituality

TODO: maybe rename this page to 'wisdom' or 'clarity' or 'human_growth'?
