# Finding Books

Buddhism and zen have been around for an exceedingly long time. This works to
your advantage in many ways. One such way is that your public library will
likely be a great resource for such books.

My local San Jose MLK Library has many dozens of books on the subject, providing
a near endless source of free wisdom for the aspiring adventurer of the mind.

Dewey Decimal class 290 is for *Other Religions* -- you can find /Buddhism/ (and
many others) under 294.
