# Slipping out of the Mainstream

Over the years I've found myself drifting further and further away from
mainstream, consumerist society. There are a *lot* of options out there, if
you're willing to give up some of the luxuries that the media tells us that we
need. More often than not, they're rooted in the values of *cooperation*,
*compassion*, and *interdependence*.
