# problem solving: getting unstuck

some article notes


## step 1

sit down with the problem

focus on it

don't turn away from it

experience, without judgment, the feelings that come up while facing it


## step 2

determine how to take a step forward

I like to sometimes talk to the problem, aloud if possible (see [rubber
ducking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)), to help me
process and understanding what the problem really is, and to figure out how to
make a single meaningful stride forward


## step 3

manage your expectations

imagining where you think you *should* be by now is poisonous and induces
anxiety. very hard place to be if you're stuck on a problem that you're solving
for e.g. work or on a deadline

stay in the present. when your mind wanders and you catch it, reel it back to
the feelings in the body of the present moment
